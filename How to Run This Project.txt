Step 1 : First Create a virtual Env and activate your env
step 2 : Go to backend folder through terminal and run pip install  "pip install -r requirements.txt"  // for installing all the packages 	required in django
step 3 : run  "python manage.py makemigrations" and then "python manage.py migrate" // create a database
step 4 : and then run "python populate.py" // it will populate data in your database (in backend folder you will see a file name populate.py which contains a scripts            for populating data in your database 
step 5 : create a superuser  by "python manage.py createsuperuser" // creates a superuser
step 6 : then finally run "python manage.py runserver" 
step 7 : In another terminal, inside backend folder you got a folder name frontend so go to this directory and run command "npm install" so                    	that it install all the packages. // install required packages in react
(Note if you get an error during npm run build then simplly run these two commands "npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled" and "npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components"
before running "npm run build" )
step 8 : in frontend terminal run npm build 
step 9 : in frontend terminal run npm start

after all these steps go to react server and use all funcationallity
